# Native Auto Reconnect Design

This is the active plugin contract for native BLE auto reconnect. Android Companion Device
Manager is intentionally out of scope for the active implementation; older CDM
documents in this repo are archived research notes, not current APIs.

For repository architecture and channel contracts, see `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Goal

`flutter_ezw_ble` provides a native auto reconnect supervisor for devices that have already reached the business `connected` state. Android and iOS own reconnect scheduling, cancellation, backoff, and GATT readiness rebuild. Dart callers keep the existing `connectStatusEC` flow and only opt in through `BleConfig`.

This design is intended for `even_connect` integration: `even_connect` declares which device configs support native auto reconnect, listens to the existing connection stream, sends the G2 business authentication command when `connectFinish` arrives, then calls the exact-attempt `prepareBusinessConnection` / `commitBusinessConnection` pair with that event's `uuid`, `sessionGeneration`, and `attemptGeneration`. `devicePreConnected(uuid)` / `deviceConnected(uuid)` remain as legacy G1/R1 compatibility APIs.

For G2, the scan config must keep `BleScan.matchCount = 2`. G2 is exposed to business code as one whole device only after both BLE endpoints with the same SN have been paired by the native scanner. A single-leg scan hit must not be shown as a connectable G2 item.

## Public Contract

Add these fields to `BleConfig`:

| Field | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `autoReconnect` | `false` | Enables native auto reconnect for devices using this config. |
| `autoReconnectMaxAttempts` | `0` | Legacy/backoff compatibility field. Native reconnect no longer stops because this count is reached. |
| `autoReconnectUseNativePassive` | `true` | Allows platform passive reconnect paths when active reconnect cannot see the device. |
| `securityGate` | `null` | Optional Android/iOS protected-write gate. G2 uses 5403 to establish/verify link security before ordinary Notify/AUTH; Android falls back to exact-session Bond only when old firmware lacks a writable gate. |
| `androidHighReliabilityMode` | `false` | Uses Android 1M-first, RSSI-adaptive PHY and traffic-aware connection priority for explicitly opted-in configs. |

`autoReconnectUseNativePassive` is now a legacy compatibility field. Reconnect
activation always uses the platform-native pending/direct path and never falls
back to scan-first because this flag is false.

Public methods:

- `armAutoReconnectTargets(devices)` records long-lived owners only.
- `activateAutoReconnectTargets(devices, source, mode, sessionGeneration, otaContext?)` immediately opens,
  reuses, or reconciles a pending direct connection for every target. `source`
  is `autoReconnect` or `manualReconnect`; `mode` is `initial`, `reconcile`, or
  `promotion`. `initial` may create a persisted owner, `reconcile` must compare
  the requested endpoint/session with the realtime native owner, and
  `promotion` uses the manual source semantics for an existing pending owner
  instead of opening a duplicate connection. On iOS activation first resolves a
  matching stable UUID or unique exact endpoint name, then either enters the
  Gate or attaches the current pending admission without issuing a duplicate
  `connect`. It returns one acknowledgement per target: `resolved` means native
  owns a stable UUID/address, `identityPending` means iOS owns an exact
  config/name identity awaiting a CoreBluetooth UUID, and `rejected` means no
  native reconnect owner exists. Every acknowledgement also carries
  `ownerDisposition`: `created`, `reused`, `repaired`, `deferred`, or
  `rejected`. Callers must not treat desired targets as active until both the
  compatibility state and owner disposition are accepted; missing, duplicated,
  or unknown acknowledgement states/dispositions fail closed. When `otaContext`
  is present, activation is an internal G2 OTA recovery path: native must verify
  the transaction is active, the endpoint belongs to the frozen set, the
  endpoint is not parked/retired, and recovery was authorized by the existing
  supervisor owner. Ordinary activation without this context remains blocked by
  active/waiting/parked/retiring OTA ownership.
- `notifyAutoReconnectTargetVisible(uuid, name)` is a scan hint, not a second
  connection owner. Android returns `true` only when it takes over that exact
  target's pre-physical passive GATT or pending retry and queues one serialized
  `connectGatt(autoConnect=false)` attempt. It keeps the same autoReconnect
  source and long-lived passive owner after that direct attempt ends. iOS returns
  `false` because CoreBluetooth pending connect remains authoritative.
- `prepareBusinessConnection(BleBusinessConnectionAttempt)` installs an
  in-memory lease for the exact endpoint/sessionGeneration/attemptGeneration
  that emitted `connectFinish`. Repeating the same token is idempotent and a
  different token replaces the old lease for that endpoint. The lease only opens
  the bounded auth grace window; rejection does not cancel the reconnect owner.
- `commitBusinessConnection(BleBusinessConnectionAttempt)` is the G2 final
  business-connected boundary. Native must still own the same admission and
  physical GATT/CBPeripheral, the device must remain physically connected, and
  write/read/notify readiness for every configured private service must be
  complete. It returns `accepted` only after native has published `connected`.
- `abortBusinessConnection(BleBusinessConnectionAttempt)` removes only an exact
  matching lease. Stale aborts are no-ops and must not disconnect, remove
  persisted autoReconnect intent, or delete a newer prepared token.
- `setConnectionTraceEnabled(enabled)` gates optional native connection Trace
  snapshots. The default is `false`. Disabling only clears process-local trace
  buffers and iOS RSSI timers; it must not disconnect, cancel, or reschedule
  autoReconnect. Enabling starts with the next real physical attempt and does
  not reconstruct an already-running connection.

Every reconnect status event carries `source`, `generation`,
`sessionGeneration`, and `attemptGeneration`. `generation` is retained as the
serialized compatibility key and always equals the Dart session generation.
`attemptGeneration` is the platform Gate/callback ownership generation. For
legacy or non-session callers, native falls back `sessionGeneration` to the
attempt generation. Old payloads decode as `source=unknown`,
`sessionGeneration=0`, and `attemptGeneration=0`.

When Trace is enabled, each `connectStatus` event may also carry `nativeTrace`.
The snapshot is process-local and never persisted. A native `attemptId` is a
UUID generated for one real physical GATT/CoreBluetooth attempt; it is separate
from `sessionGeneration` and `attemptGeneration`, which remain ownership
guards. `steps` retain at most 32 entries, de-duplicate repeated
`stage/result/serviceType`, normalize retained `stepSeq` to a continuous
snapshot order, and emit `trace/gap` with `droppedCount` on overflow while
preserving the first record and latest terminal record. Native records
`attempt`, `scan`, `connect`, `bond`, `service_discovery`,
`characteristic_discovery`, `cccd`, `mtu`, `gatt_ready`, and `disconnect`
stages only; `gatt_ready` is not a business `attempt_result`.

## State Flow

Native auto reconnect reuses the existing connection states:

```text
connected
  -> disconnectFromSys
  -> [native pending direct connect; no visible state]
  -> contactDevice(source, generation)
  -> searchService
  -> searchChars
  -> connectFinish
  -> connected
```

No new EventChannel is required. Automatic reconnect must not emit `connecting`
before a physical callback. Existing terminal states (`timeout`, `serviceFail`,
`charsFail`, `noDeviceFound`) describe one attempt and do not delete the task.
`securityRecoveryExhausted` is the only new silent terminal: it closes native
resources and retires one iOS endpoint's automatic Security Gate owner after
five real protected-write security failures, but it is not an error or
disconnected state for generic UI mapping.

## Reconnect Task Lifecycle

Each platform keeps one reconnect task per device:

```text
belongConfig
uuid
name
sn or mac
attempt
pending native connection handle owned by the OS
pausedByBluetoothOff
awaitingRecoveryActivation
attempt source
sessionGeneration
attemptGeneration
```

The task is normally armed after `deviceConnected(uuid)`. On a later cold start,
Dart may seed the already-bound targets and activate them immediately; this is
still recovery of a previously authorized owner, not retry of an unknown
first-connect failure.

The task is a long-lived reconnect intent. Native must keep it alive until an
explicit owner cancels it, because timeout/noDeviceFound/service failures only
describe one failed attempt, not the end of the reconnect contract.

Cancel the task only on:

- `disconnectDevice`
- `resetBle`
- `cleanConnectCache`
- `removeBond`
- config removed or `autoReconnect=false`
- plugin release

Pause the task on Bluetooth off. When Bluetooth returns to powered on, native
sets `awaitingRecoveryActivation` and resets the source to `autoReconnect`, but
does not open a GATT with the pre-reset session. Dart first combines every
eligible glasses/ring endpoint into one final recovery session, then
`activateAutoReconnectTargets` consumes the barrier and creates the only
physical owner. This prevents an old-session callback from racing the combined
batch and being closed immediately by an exact session rebind.

## Trigger Rules

Schedule reconnect when all are true:

- The device's `BleConfig.autoReconnect == true`.
- The device has reached business `connected` before, or Dart has seeded it from the bound-device cache.
- The state is `disconnectFromSys`, `timeout`, `serviceFail`, `charsFail`, or `noDeviceFound`.
- The failure was not caused by user disconnect, reset, remove-bond, or expected OTA transition.
- Bluetooth is currently usable, or the task can be paused until it is usable.

Do not schedule reconnect for:

- `disconnectByUser`
- `emptyUuid`
- `noBleConfigFound`
- `alreadyBound`
- `boundFail`
- `bleError`
- `systemError`
- Devices currently in `upgrade`

## iOS R1 Peer Pairing Recovery

An automatic CoreBluetooth Code 14 does not immediately terminate the native
reconnect intent. The first exact automatic failure moves the owner to
`awaitingFreshAdvertisement` and purges the stale scan cache. While the app is
active and Bluetooth is powered on, native repeats a 10-second exact scan window
followed by a 5-second quiet wait until the target advertises. A window miss is
not a connection terminal: it must not emit `alreadyBound`, `noDeviceFound`, or
an attempt generation of zero, and it must not delete the reconnect owner.

The scan match requires the current config, full device name, and the persisted
MAC suffix when both sides expose one. The recovery attempt uses the
`CBPeripheral` delivered by that advertisement and allocates a new positive
Gate attempt; it must not retrieve the previously rejected peripheral. A second
Code 14 from this fresh peripheral stops the automatic owner and writes the
existing stopped marker without requesting user UI. Any non-Code14 timeout or
disconnect exits the specialized recovery state and returns the owner to normal
persistent auto reconnect.

The 5-second wait is an explicit owner state and cannot consume a shared scan's
results. Only a scan started by this owner may be stopped by it. App inactivity,
termination, or Bluetooth off cancels the scan/timer but preserves the exact
owner; resume is allowed only after config, owner, session generation, app
lifecycle, and Bluetooth state are revalidated.

A manual activation cancels an automatic scan/wait immediately. If the fresh
automatic attempt is already connecting, native first neutral-cancels that
admission and waits for its cancellation barrier before creating a distinct
manual generation. The old automatic source is never promoted to manual. Only
an exact positive manual physical attempt that itself returns Code 14 may emit
`alreadyBound`; a manual scan miss remains `noDeviceFound`, and stale automatic
callbacks remain silent.

## Pending Session and Timeout Boundary

Native reconnect is a persistent intent after `deviceConnected(uuid)`. Reaching
`autoReconnectMaxAttempts`, `timeout`, `noDeviceFound`, `serviceFail`, or
`charsFail` must not delete the task.

Waiting in the global admission queue is not part of `connectTimeout`. The
business-pipeline timeout starts only after a real
`STATE_CONNECTED` / `didConnect` callback has been granted the Gate. On Android,
an `initiateBinding=true` owner may first hold that same Gate while system bonding
completes; service discovery starts only after `BOND_BONDED`. The timeout remains
active through bonding and `connectFinish` until final
`deviceConnected`, with the existing bounded auth grace.

Android bounds only the pre-physical-callback lifetime of each pending
`connectGatt(autoConnect=true)` by `BleConfig.connectTimeout` (minimum 1s). On
expiry it first classifies the exact owner as pre-physical, Gate-admitted,
business-connected, or stale. Only an exact pre-physical owner is normally
recycled. Gate-admitted and business-connected owners keep their GATT. A stale
Supervisor/Manager/Gate identity is repaired explicitly: the orphan is removed,
and a replacement is created only when Manager does not already own another
healthy GATT. No boolean failure path may silently preserve a fake owner.
Consecutive
pre-physical deadline failures rebuild after 1.5s for failures 1–3, 5s for
failures 4–10, and 30s from failure 11 onward. A matching scan-visible hint
resets the streak and rebuilds after a 250ms debounce. This refresh is
native-only: it neither emits Dart/UI `timeout` nor deletes the long-lived
reconnect task. Receiving `STATE_CONNECTED` cancels this deadline before Gate
admission, so a queued GATT is never recycled while waiting for another endpoint.
iOS immediately leaves a known `CBPeripheral` pending in CoreBluetooth; its
pending connect is not recycled by this Android-specific deadline.

## Global Connection Admission Gate

All targets may be pending at the physical-link layer at the same time. From
the first physical callback onward, one process-wide Gate serializes service
discovery, characteristic discovery, CCCD/notify setup, and business auth:

- automatic callbacks enter FIFO order;
- a manual reconnect already waiting is preferred over automatic waiters;
- manual never preempts the active owner;
- queue time is excluded from the timeout;
- `connectFinish` does not release the owner;
- business `deviceConnected`, or an acknowledged terminal teardown, releases
the owner and starts the next endpoint.

On Android the active Gate also serializes proactive system bonding for configs
with `initiateBinding=true`. A `BONDING` owner keeps the Gate; `BOND_BONDED`
resumes service discovery on the exact GATT/session, while an explicit
`BOND_BONDING -> BOND_NONE` terminates that session before the next owner starts.
Android G2 uses this Bond-first path so `createBond()` is the only pairing-dialog
trigger. After Bond completes, the 5403 protected write verifies the current link
key before ordinary Notify. Already-bonded devices skip `createBond()` and still
execute 5403. Configs with `initiateBinding=false` enter service discovery
directly; the missing-5403 post-discovery Bond path remains only as a defensive
fallback for legacy persisted configs or a concurrent Bond-state change.

Every admission is identified by endpoint + attemptGeneration + session and, at
the platform boundary, the exact GATT/peripheral object. Status events expose
the Dart sessionGeneration separately so a reconnect batch can remain stable
while native retries advance attempt ownership. Stale callbacks fail closed.

Android Manager and Gate maintain the same per-endpoint attempt-generation
high-water mark. A batch cancellation advances that mark exactly once before
tearing down its endpoint runtimes; the per-endpoint release step must not
advance it again. A later attempt is allocated from the maximum high-water mark
observed by either side. This keeps a valid post-cancellation physical callback
from being rejected as stale after OTA, device switching, or repeated cleanup.

## GATT Reconnect Readiness

Native reconnect is successful only after the optional Security Gate and every configured private service are restored:

1. Discover all services.
2. On Android or iOS, if `BleConfig.securityGate` is configured and the gate
   characteristic is present, issue exactly one with-response protected write
   before ordinary private-service discovery/Notify. Do not emit
   `connectFinish` while this write is pending.
3. If the gate characteristic is absent or cannot be written with response,
   normally Bond-first Android G2 is already `BONDED` and continues ordinary
   readiness for old firmware. The defensive fallback still handles `NONE` with
   exact-session `createBond()` and rediscovery, and `BONDING` by waiting for its
   authoritative broadcast. iOS continues ordinary readiness directly. Gate
   absence itself is not a security failure and does not consume recovery budget.
4. For every `BlePrivateService`, find the write characteristic.
5. For every `BlePrivateService`, find the read characteristic.
6. Enable notify/CCCD for every read characteristic.
7. Emit `connectFinish` only after Security Gate has passed or fallen back and
   all configured services pass.

If any service, characteristic, or notify setup fails, native emits the existing failure state and schedules the next reconnect attempt.

For iOS, the finish gate must require:

```swift
writeCharsDic.count == bleConfig.privateServices.count
readCharsDic.count == bleConfig.privateServices.count
readCharsNotify == bleConfig.privateServices.count
```

This prevents multi-service devices from reaching `connectFinish` after only the first notify succeeds.

## G2 Security Gate Recovery

The 5403 protected write is the first shared-key validation breakpoint for
Android/iOS bond or LTK mismatch. Android may first complete the explicit system
Bond Gate; both platforms must still run 5403 before ordinary Notify
subscriptions, G2 AUTH, or `connectFinish` so a failed security setup cannot
masquerade as a business AUTH timeout.

Automatic recovery is scoped by endpoint, recovery episode, positive
`sessionGeneration`, and positive `attemptGeneration`:

- Only actual Security Gate failures count: CBATT security errors from the
  5403 write, peer-pairing-removed equivalents, and (iOS) a connect timeout that
  fires while the exact 5403 write is still in flight — the timeout and the
  write callback consume the same exact attempt atomically, whichever comes
  first. Bluetooth off, App inactive/background, scan misses, ordinary connection
  timeout before the write, and missing or unsupported 5403 do not consume the
  budget.
- The first failed 5403 write is attempt 1. On iOS, automatic attempts 1
  through 4 (including `stateRestoration` owners) persist the count, cancel the
  old attempt through the cancellation barrier, and — after the exact
  CoreBluetooth terminal callback or the 2-second barrier watchdog — let the
  same reconnect owner reschedule `disconnectFromSys`, register a new exact
  attempt/admission and issue an ordinary CoreBluetooth pending connect
  (`retryPendingConnect`). While the App is inactive this reuses only the
  in-process `CBPeripheral`; no synchronous retrieve and no scan is involved.
  If the link is still held at system level the connect completes immediately
  and a fresh exact 5403 runs; if the link dropped, the pending connect waits
  for the next connectable advertisement without consuming budget.
- G2 5403 recovery must not reuse the R1 Code 14 fresh-advertisement recovery.
  The G2 right leg is the iOS ANCS client: `com.apple.BTLEServer` keeps its link
  up even after the App cancels its own connection, so it never advertises,
  and the fresh-advertisement scan only runs while the App is active
  (2026-09-18 device incident: one 5403 timeout during an SR headless launch
  left the glasses single-legged for 2 h 11 min; a manual connect over the same
  system-held link passed 5403 in 49 ms). A 5403 failure also does not mark the
  owner as having used its Code 14 recovery, so a later first Code 14 still gets
  one fresh-advertisement window.
- The fifth real 5403 security failure publishes
  `securityRecoveryExhausted`, removes that endpoint's automatic owner, and
  must not create a sixth automatic connection.
- Passing 5403, target change, unbind, or a user manual connect clears the
  counter and stopped marker for that endpoint. Manual connect does not run the
  five-attempt silent loop; its first final Security Gate failure maps to the
  existing `boundFail` path so the app can show the current repair dialog.
- App inactive/background pauses synchronous retrieve and scan work. A 5403
  retry whose owner still holds an in-process peripheral keeps going as a
  pending connect; owners without one are deferred. Returning active resumes
  only exact owners that still match config, endpoint, and session generation.
- iOS active cold-start reconciliation hands a resolved system object to the
  exact activation path in both branches (with or without an existing physical
  session). It must not escrow and re-arm the object first: a re-armed
  `connect` is issued before any owner claims it, so an owner that declines to
  connect (Code 14 fresh-advertisement wait, transport recovery gate, Bluetooth
  pause, OTA gate) left a system-held link to complete `didConnect` with no
  active request and report `noBleConfigFound` with generation 0.

Android and iOS both execute the Security Gate and may emit
`securityRecoveryExhausted`. Android additionally treats an explicit rejection
or failure of Bond-first `createBond()` (or the defensive missing-5403 fallback)
as a real security attempt; simply detecting missing/unsupported 5403 does not
consume the budget.

## Android Strategy

Reconnect activation always calls
`BluetoothDevice.connectGatt(..., autoConnect=true, ...)` for every target. It
does not first enter `connect(...)`, scan-refresh, or the scan-then-connect
queue. The app may scan concurrently for at most 20 seconds, but scan visibility
is not an admission prerequisite. When that auxiliary scan does confirm an
unresolved target, Android atomically replaces only its exact pre-physical
passive GATT with one globally serialized `connectGatt(..., autoConnect=false,
...)` attempt; this is an acceleration path, not a second owner or a UI state.

All three Android GATT creation paths share the same initial-PHY selector.
Configs with `androidHighReliabilityMode=true` start on LE 1M instead of forcing
LE 2M. Android documents that the `connectGatt` PHY argument is ignored when
`autoConnect=true`, so every real `STATE_CONNECTED` callback for that config
also requests 1M before adaptive monitoring begins. RSSI is sampled every five
seconds with hysteresis (`>= -60dBm` may promote to 2M; `<= -70dBm` falls back
to 1M). Real notify/write traffic keeps connection priority HIGH, while ten
seconds of inactivity returns it to BALANCED. These are controller preferences
and diagnostics only: a rejected priority/RSSI/PHY request must not create a
terminal state, replace the admission owner, or publish business connected.

Each Android passive handle has an exact pre-physical deadline as described
above. The deadline must compare the GATT object and admission generation before
closing; a late callback from an expired handle must fail closed and a GATT that
has reached the Gate must remain alive until normal terminal teardown.

After business `deviceConnected` releases the Gate, the live GATT remains the
physical owner. Android stores its exact admission metadata and GATT identity.
A later `STATE_DISCONNECTED` from that exact `(sessionId, GATT)` must still emit
`disconnectFromSys`, clear the task's `passiveGatt`, and create a new passive
handle. A callback from any older GATT/session must not change the newer
attempt.

On iOS, exact business commit stores the accepted `sessionGeneration` and
`attemptGeneration` as one reconnect-task snapshot before the Gate is released.
CoreBluetooth terminal callbacks do not carry a business token, so a later
`didDisconnect` must reuse that exact pair. A current admission always wins over
the historical task snapshot, preventing an old attempt from terminating its
replacement.

On Bluetooth-on, Android does not replay paused tasks by itself. It waits for
the Dart recovery activation carrying the final `sessionGeneration`; ordinary
`arm` calls cannot consume this barrier. Manual promotion also classifies the
native owner first. A stale `passiveGatt` is repaired or dropped instead of
being reported as reusable. A real Gate/business owner is never closed by an
ordinary activation. The only business-GATT replacement exception is a current
G2 OTA endpoint already in `RECOVERING`: the native transaction credential and
the frozen positive `sessionGeneration/attemptGeneration` must both match the
old business session. Manager then retires that exact GATT without emitting or
scheduling a generic disconnect, and the same supervisor activation installs
the requested higher session before creating one replacement. Missing/stale
credentials, a mismatched physical pair, and active/parked/retired endpoints
remain rejected.

If a system terminal callback reaches Manager before the ordinary OTA gate
check, Android must first exact-match the callback GATT against the supervisor's
current `passiveGatt` and neutralize only that handle. The subsequent gate may
still reject ordinary reconnect while OTA is active; rejection must leave no
stale `passiveGatt` and must not create a generic retry.
Repeated `reconcile` activation follows the same exact endpoint/session check:
healthy task/GATT/Gate owners return `reused`, missing runtime tasks with a
valid persisted authorization recreate a single pending GATT and return `repaired`, and
orphan Supervisor/GATT state is first invalidated through Manager/Gate before
the replacement returns `repaired`. Unbound targets, explicit disconnects, OTA
owners, persisted security exhaustion, disabled configs, Bluetooth-off barriers,
and stale/lower sessions never resurrect a closed owner.

On iOS the activation ACK is computed from the owner visible when the
MethodChannel call returns. A reconnect task alone is not a live owner.
`reused` requires an exact admission/session pair whose `CBPeripheral` is still
connecting or connected. A missing session, mismatched session generation, or
disconnected peripheral is repaired only for that endpoint; an in-flight
CoreBluetooth request first enters the existing cancellation barrier. If no
peripheral is available in the active lifecycle window, the task remains armed
and the ACK is `deferred`, never `reused`.

## iOS Strategy

iOS uses CoreBluetooth pending connects without an internal scan-first phase.
After a previously business-connected device disconnects, the app hands a known
`CBPeripheral` back to CoreBluetooth immediately. That pending `connect` is the
preserved operation while the process is alive. If the process is reclaimed, the
next app launch starts a new cold-start activation batch instead of claiming an
old CoreBluetooth peripheral escrow.

`CBManagerState.resetting` is a transport-loss boundary, not a connection
window. Native pauses and invalidates the old attempt while the central is not
`poweredOn`. When `poweredOn` returns, native marks each paused task
`awaitingRecoveryActivation` but does not replay the pre-reset session. Only an
explicit activation carrying a newer positive final recovery session and the
exact current process-local `recoveryEpoch` may clear that flag and create the
next pending connect. Dart reads the epoch after BLE becomes available and
passes it unchanged with activation; another reset between the query and
activation makes that request stale. Arm-only calls, connection events, old
timers, and lifecycle compensation preserve the barrier.

The central manager uses the main queue (`queue: nil`), so synchronous
`retrieveConnectedPeripherals` and `retrievePeripherals` calls are allowed only
while the host app is active. `willResignActive`, `didEnterBackground`, and
`willTerminate` close this gate immediately; only `didBecomeActive` reopens it.
This prevents a MethodChannel activation during the process-exit grace window
from blocking the main thread in CoreBluetooth synchronous XPC.

While inactive, only a peripheral already held in the process may still use the
existing Gate/pending-connect path. A name-only owner stays `identityPending`
with reason `appInactiveDeferred`; a UUID owner records
`deferredByAppInactivity`. Neither path emits `noDeviceFound`, advances retry,
or removes the long-lived owner. On `didBecomeActive`, native revalidates the
current config, owner key, and session generation before one compensation pass:
name-only system-connected hits reuse `resolvePendingReconnectIdentity`, and
UUID owners reuse the normal activation/Gate path. Cancelled, replaced, or
revoked owners fail closed.

iOS lookup order:

1. `retrieveConnectedPeripherals(withServices:)`, using configured private services plus ANCS.
2. `retrievePeripherals(withIdentifiers:)`.
3. If a peripheral is known, call `centralManager.connect` immediately with the native reconnect option when available.
4. If no peripheral is known, keep the task armed and wait for the app's
   concurrent scan/cache update or a later active retrieve opportunity.

After reinstall, a server-restored UUID can be stale while the matching endpoint
is already system-connected and no longer advertising. The first lookup therefore
matches either the stable UUID or the exact non-empty endpoint name; when it finds
a new CoreBluetooth UUID, identity migration must finish before admission is
registered. The migrated peripheral then uses the existing Gate/GATT pipeline.

iOS 17+ may pass `CBConnectPeripheralOptionEnableAutoReconnect` when available.
Lower versions still keep a pending `centralManager.connect` for a known
peripheral and rely on CoreBluetooth to complete the connection when the device
returns. Hosts keep `UIBackgroundModes = bluetooth-central` for ordinary
background BLE capability. Process relaunch starts a new cold-start connection
flow.

Do not start the short connect timeout while the reconnect is only pending in CoreBluetooth; otherwise the app can cancel the preserved connect before the peripheral returns. Start the normal timeout after `didConnect`, then require service discovery, characteristic discovery, CCCD writes, `connectFinish`, G2 AUTH, and final `deviceConnected`.

CoreBluetooth pending connect is the iOS long-wait mechanism. App timers may
update diagnostics, but must not cancel the pending connect or emit a Dart/UI
timeout just because the peripheral stayed away for minutes or hours.

`connectedDevices` is only a per-process business/GATT cache, never the source
of truth for a physical iOS link. It is keyed by stable CoreBluetooth UUID, not
the `CBPeripheral` object identity: retrieve/cache paths may return a different
object instance for the same UUID. A reconnect may skip `centralManager.connect`
only when the cache is business-connected **and** that peripheral's physical
state is `.connected`. On every terminal state all same-UUID cache entries are
invalidated; before a new pending attempt they are replaced by one current
peripheral entry. This prevents a stale `isConnected=true` entry from silently
leaving an autoReconnect task armed without a CoreBluetooth pending connect.

Non-CoreBluetooth terminal states must not release the global Gate until
`didFailToConnect` / `didDisconnect` acknowledges teardown. A bounded 2-second
watchdog prevents permanent blocking when CoreBluetooth omits the callback.
Timed-out cancellation debt is stored as one saturating counter per endpoint,
not an array. Late callbacks consume debt before an active barrier; however, if
the new generation has already reached business `connected`, a real
`didDisconnect` must continue through normal cleanup/reconnect instead of being
swallowed as old debt.

After an acknowledged terminal releases admission, iOS must remove the old
active request before scheduling the next generation. Barrier completion owns
this ordering for deferred teardown; the ordinary terminal path must use the
same cleanup-before-schedule rule and must not schedule a second time.

Before Bluetooth-off teardown clears admission, each platform snapshots the
active sessionGeneration and attemptGeneration for connecting endpoints. A
business-connected reconnect task keeps its last successful exact pair. The
emitted `disconnectFromSys` reuses both accepted generations instead of falling
back to `source=unknown`, session zero, or attempt zero. Android serializes this transport barrier with
admission, upgrade-state, and runtime teardown mutations. If a legacy race has
already removed admission, only a live reconnect owner with an accepted epoch
may restore terminal metadata; a cache with no owner is quarantined and its
physical resources are released without crashing the broadcast receiver.

OTA upgrade state is a projection of an existing business-connected epoch, not
a connection owner. Entering upgrade requires a live connected endpoint and an
accepted epoch. Exiting upgrade may emit `connected` only while that same
physical connection remains live; a late OTA cleanup after disconnect consumes
the marker without resurrecting cached connection state.

If a concurrent scan finds the same stable device name under a new
CoreBluetooth UUID, task, persistence owner, and Gate identity migrate
atomically before admission. Each canonical target retains at most two direct
aliases: the earliest UI owner and the most recent old identity. This preserves
hard cancel reachability without linear memory growth.

## even_connect Integration

1. Enable `autoReconnect` on the desired `BleConfig`.
2. On cold start, Bluetooth recovery, or reconnect entry, call
   `activateAutoReconnectTargets` with all bound endpoints. Use `mode=initial`
   for the first batch, `mode=reconcile` when reusing a recovery batch whose
   business endpoint is not connected, and `mode=promotion` only for a user
   click. Use `manualReconnect` only for a user click; otherwise use
   `autoReconnect`.
   Keep desired, activation-in-flight, and native-accepted targets separate so
   a rejected or lost acknowledgement cannot leave a phantom active batch.
   While Bluetooth is unavailable, system-disconnect callbacks may update
   business state but must not create per-endpoint activation sessions.
   Bluetooth available consumes that recovery debt once and submits the
   combined endpoint set.
   On iOS, the combined batch remains useful for one cold-start session, but
   there is no finalize step.
3. Start the app-level scan concurrently, never before direct activation. Stop
   it when all devices connect or at 20 seconds, whichever comes first. A later
   Bluetooth-on recovery trigger may reopen only this scan window for the same
   native owner; it must not activate the targets again or advance generation.
4. For G2, keep `scan.matchCount = 2`; scan aggregation must not serialize the
   native direct attempts.
5. Keep listening to `connectStatusEC`. Show automatic "connecting" UI only
   after a reconnect-owned status callback actually arrives. Hide that UI after
   one minute without cancelling native reconnect. A manual request uses the
   same one-minute display timeout and may show a timeout prompt, but still does
   not cancel native reconnect.
6. Stop running a parallel Dart reconnect loop for native-managed configs.
7. On `connectFinish`, capture `uuid`, `sessionGeneration`, and `attemptGeneration`, then send G2 `AUTHENTICATION(0x04)` through `UX_DEVICE_SETTINGS_APP_ID(0x80)` with `AuthMgr.secAuth = true`, the platform-specific `phoneType`, `syncBoth = false`, `timeout = 500ms`, and `maxRetry = 1`.
8. Wait for the `DevCfgDataPackage` callback. Only when `authMgr.secAuth == true`, call `prepareBusinessConnection(attempt)` to enter the bounded auth grace window. If it returns anything except `accepted`, stop that business attempt and let native reconnect continue.
9. For the right leg, send `PIPE_ROLE_CHANGE(0x05)` with `asCmdRole = RIGHT`, then send `TIME_SYNC(0x80)` with the current timestamp and 15-minute timezone unit.
10. Call `commitBusinessConnection(attempt)` in the post-auth success path so native can publish the final `connected` state and release the Gate. On local cancellation or stale orchestration, call `abortBusinessConnection(attempt)`; do not add command retries to compensate for a rejected commit.
11. Any visible cancel action is a hard cancel: call `disconnectDevice`, stop
    automatic connection, and do not reactivate until the next explicit manual
    connect.

## Acceptance Matrix

- User disconnect does not reconnect.
- A visible cancel is a hard cancel; a one-minute UI timeout alone is not.
- All endpoints enter pending direct connect before the concurrent scan starts.
- Concurrent scan stops at all-connected or 20 seconds.
- Automatic UI appears only after a reconnect-owned status callback and hides
  after one minute without stopping native reconnect.
- Device power loss then power restore reconnects to `connectFinish`.
- All private services are writable and notify-capable after reconnect.
- Bluetooth off pauses tasks; Bluetooth on waits for one final combined Dart
  activation before native opens replacement GATT handles.
- Bluetooth-off terminals preserve the active or last business-connected
  session/attempt exact pair, so Dart can accept the disconnect before reconnect resumes.
- iOS business-connected `didDisconnect` after Gate release reuses the last
  accepted exact pair; a historical task cannot override a current admission.
- Bluetooth-off teardown cannot crash on a missing admission; it recovers only
  from a valid reconnect owner or quarantines the ownerless cache.
- A late OTA exit after transport loss never changes the endpoint back to
  `connected` on either platform.
- iOS ANCS/system-connected devices do not fall into scan timeout.
- iOS inactive/background/terminating paths do not call either synchronous
  retrieve API, manufacture `noDeviceFound`, or advance reconnect attempts;
  active compensation only resumes the exact current owner/generation.
- Android out-of-range devices recover through the mandatory passive reconnect path.
- Android business-connected system disconnect rebuilds `passiveGatt`; an old
  GATT/session cannot terminate a newer attempt.
- iOS repeated cancellation watchdog expiry remains constant-memory, and a live
  system disconnect is not hidden by old cancellation debt.
- Repeated iOS UUID drift keeps at most two aliases per canonical target.
- Long out-of-range periods do not stop native reconnect unless user/business explicitly cancels it.
- OTA state is not hijacked by normal auto reconnect.
- Authentication hang after `connectFinish` times out and retries instead of getting stuck.
- G2 scan results are displayed only after both legs are matched by `matchCount = 2`.
- G2 is marked business-connected only after `AUTHENTICATION` returns `authMgr.secAuth == true`; right-leg `PIPE_ROLE_CHANGE` and `TIME_SYNC` run before final `deviceConnected`.
